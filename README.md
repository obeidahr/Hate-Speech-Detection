# Hate Speech Detection using Deep Learning
There must be times when you have come across some social media post whose main aim is to spread hate and controversies or use abusive language on social media platforms. As the post consists of textual information to filter out such Hate Speeches NLP comes in handy. This is one of the main applications of NLP which is known as Sentence Classification tasks.

and learn how to build an NLP-based Sequence Classification model which can predict Tweets as Hate Speech, Offensive Language, and Normal.

## Conclusion
The model we have trained is a little over fitting the training data but we can handle this by using different regularization techniques. But still, we had achieved 90% accuracy on the validation data which is quite sufficient to prove the power of LSTM models in NLP-related tasks.
